The results of the functional enrichment analysis shed light on the potential functional 
implications of the differential gene expression observed between the neanderthal variant 
(GLI3C and GLI3T) and the human GLI3 gene. Specifically, the upregulation of cancer-related 
pathways in the neanderthal variant compared to human GLI3 suggests a potential survival 
disadvantage associated with this variant in humans. This finding aligns with previous studies 
that have shown an increased susceptibility to certain types of cancers in neanderthals 
compared to modern humans. The enrichment of cancer-related pathways in the neanderthal 
variant provides a plausible explanation for the loss of this variant in humans, as it may have 
conferred a fitness disadvantage.
Additionally, the enrichment analysis revealed differences in the expression of genes involved 
in metabolic pathways between the neanderthal variant and the human GLI3 gene. This 
suggests potential variations in metabolic processes between these two variants, which could 
have functional implications in terms of energy utilization, nutrient metabolism, and overall 
metabolic homeostasis. Further investigation into the specific genes involved in these 
metabolic pathways may provide insights into the unique physiological characteristics of the 
neanderthal variant.
Moreover, the analysis highlighted changes in the expression of genes related to 
neurodegeneration pathways, specifically Alzheimer's and Huntington diseases. These 
pathways were found to be upregulated in the human transcript and downregulated in the 
neanderthal variant. This observation suggests potential differences in susceptibility to 
neurodegenerative disorders between neanderthals and modern humans. It raises intriguing 
questions about the genetic factors that may have influenced the prevalence of these diseases 
in human populations and the potential evolutionary pressures that have shaped the genetic 
landscape of neurodegeneration-related pathways.
Interestingly, genes involved in neutrophil extracellular trap formation and ubiquitin-mediated 
processes were found to be present in all the variants analyzed. This suggests the conservation 
of these genes across evolutionary lineages, indicating their significance in biological 
processes. The involvement of these genes in essential cellular functions such as immune 
response and protein degradation underscores their importance in maintaining cellular 
homeostasis and suggests their potential role in natural selection during the course of evolution.
