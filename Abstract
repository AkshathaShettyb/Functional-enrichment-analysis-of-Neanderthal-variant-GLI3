1.Introduction
Genomic structural changes play a crucial role in shaping unique human traits. Understanding 
how lineage-specific genetic variations impact phenotypic transformations during human 
evolution has been challenging. To explore the phenotypic differences between modern 
humans and Neanderthals , this project investigates a specific Neanderthal variant of the GLI3 
gene by RNA sequencing analysis. All sequenced Neanderthal carry a Arginine to Cysteine 
Functional enrichment analysis is done to study the differentially expressed genes .This study 
hopes to explore different lineage specific traits that are the results of genetic variations and 
provide plausible explanations for the evolution ,variations and similarities found between the 
two species .

3.OBJECTIVE
The objective of this study was to conduct a comparative analysis of gene expression patterns 
between Neanderthal variant substitution genes and the overexpressed modern type GLI3 gene 
in GLI3-dependent HEK293T cells.
• The study aimed to investigate the phenotypic observations resulting from the 
differential gene expression and compare them with the gene expression profile of the 
modern GLI3 gene in HEK293T cells.
• The primary objective was to identify potential functional differences and phenotypic 
implications associated with the Neanderthal variant substitution genes compared to the 
modern GLI3 gene in the context of GLI3-dependent cellular processes.


3.Methodology and tools used 

3.1.RAW SEQUENCE 
The paired-end sequences associated with the PRJDB14207 ID were downloaded from the 
ENA database.. The ENA serves as a comprehensive repository for nucleotide sequence data 
and is widely used for storing and sharing genomic datasets. Total of 9 samples were retrieved
from this data base.( PRJDB14207 - SRA - NCBI (nih.gov))

3.2. QUALITY CONTROL ASSESSMENT USING FASTQC AND MULTIQC
FastQC, a widely adopted tool for quality control analysis of high-throughput sequencing data, 
was employed to assess the quality characteristics of the downloaded sequences. FastQC 
provides comprehensive metrics, including per-base sequence quality scores, sequence length 
distribution, adapter content, and identification of overrepresented sequences. The generated 
output files were saved in HTML format for subsequent analysis and visualization.
To streamline the quality control process and facilitate comprehensive data interpretation, 
MultiQC was utilized to generate an integrated quality control report. MultiQC aggregates the 
outputs of multiple tools, including FastQC, into a single report, simplifying the evaluation and 
comparison of quality metrics across multiple samples. The resulting report offered an 
overview of the sequence quality metrics and aided in the identification of potential biases and 
issues.

3.3. ALIGNMENT 
HISAT, a widely employed alignment tool, was utilized to map the paired-end sequences to 
the GRCh38 (HG38) reference genome. HISAT employed an indexing scheme to enhance the 
alignment speed and accuracy.

3.4. FEATURE COUNTS ANALYSIS
Subread is a widely used tool that enables precise and efficient gene quantification by aligning 
sequencing reads to a reference genome and assigning them to gene features. We employed 
Subread for transcript count analysis, leveraging its capabilities to accurately quantify gene 
expression levels. The obtained transcript counts were utilized for differential gene expression
analysis using DESeq2. This analysis facilitated the identification of genes that exhibited 
significant differential expression between experimental conditions or biological groups.

3.5. DIFFERENTIAL GENE EXPRESSION ANALYSIS 
Differential gene expression analysis used for the identification of genes that exhibit significant 
expression changes between different experimental conditions. We utilized DESeq2 ,a 
Bioconductor package to identify differentially expressed genes. The dataset used for 
differential gene expression analysis consisted of gene expression data from three experimental 
groups: HEK, GLI3C, and GLI3T. Four distinct comparisons were performed: 
(1) HEK vs. GLI3C and GLI3T
(2) HEK vs. GLI3C 
(3) HEK vs. GLI3T
(4) GLI3C vs. GLI3T

3.6. FUNCTIONAL ENRICHMENT ANALYSIS USING DAVID
DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery) is a widely used 
online tool for functional enrichment analysis. We employed DAVID to perform functional 
enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes, focusing on the identification of 
enriched KEGG pathways.
